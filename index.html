                        If you are a fresh graduate - or new to IT - looking for the next job, you need to read this.
                        
                        The last couple of years zekeLabs gave me a unique opportunity to assess technology demand in the industry and also to evaluate available talent pool for the demand.
                        
                        Our consulting and technology training assignments for our corporate partners enlightened us on the technology skill in demand. We discovered - What, Where and which technologies are increasingly being adopted by the Industry.
                        
                        Our interaction with the engineering graduates and IT professionals during the technology workshops, seminars and our technology skilling initiatives, We found out the current tech skill-sets of the millennial generation and the skill gap.

                        Journey through the past couple of years
                        It’s been a long time, almost 3 years since we started our journey. A lot has changed since then. The past years had stories around all the emotions that are humanly possible. There was some amazing success and of course a lot of terrible failures.
                        It was a great learning experience, nevertheless.

                        So What is DevOps all about -
                        DevOps is a paradigm shift in the way how software products are being built in the modern day Information Technology (IT) organizations. It is becoming the de-facto component in Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) process in most of the organizations.

                            But what is this all about. Here, I am exploring how DevOps can be compared to some of the similar revolutions of the past and how it is impacting the work culture in the organizations.

                            But before I dig deeper, let’s understand what DevOps truly is - DevOps can simply be defined as the “combination of cultural philosophies, practices, and tools that increases an organization’s ability to deliver applications and services at high velocity”.

                        I’ve been a Data Scientist for three years now and I can only say that Chris Lynch was right -

                        Big Data and Data Science are the foundation of all the trends that are emerging in the world today.
                        To me Data Science can be encapsulated in a simple statement, it helps organizations and individuals to solve complex problems while minimizing human effort. There are several different aspects to this, which we shall go into later.


                        Here I have tried to answer some of the frequently asked questions by friends and juniors planning to switch their profiles and roles in the areas of Business Analytics, Data Science, and Machine Learning.


                        Hopefully, this will benefit the aspiring Data Scientists

                    <h2>Amazon Web Services (AWS) Cloud Day - Bangalore</h2>

                        I recently had the opportunity to attend the AWS Cloud Day event organized by Amazon Web Services. The AWS Cloud Day brings together the cloud computing community to connect, collaborate and learn about AWS. Here, I have tried to share my learning and experience of the event. >>

                        AWS Cloud Day, Bangalore – Thursday, May 17
                        It was indeed a hectic day with back to back session sandwiched by good food and tea (on a lighter note, need to investigate the tactics behind the 5-star hotels keeping the plates so heavy. :D)

                        To me, AWS cloud day gave a lot of insights into the Business I am into -  Consulting & Training for Cloud & DevOps, and I could comprehend from the various sessions I attended, the way AWS and its business partners are moving.

                        I recently had the opportunity to lead the initiative to organize the first Cloud meetup for edYoda. Here, I recount my experience in organizing the very first in the series of meetups planned by the team here. The focus area of the meetups is emerging technologies including Big Data, Cloud, Machine Learning, Blockchain, IOT, and others. >>

                        As a trainer on Cloud and DevOps technologies when I enumerate the features of the cloud to someone from non-cloud background there seems to be a conflict of interest and bias.

                        As a matter of fact, sometimes we do get biased towards cloud services and see only the greener side of it. To do some reality check for us, as well as for other cloud practitioners we at edYoda planned a Tech Meetup on cloud services. The meetup was organized on 22nd April at our own office.
